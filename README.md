NORMAL EQUATION METHOD FOR LINEAR REGRESSION

This basically is the matrix derivaties in the working out of the least square cost function

Cost function refers to the equation involving the least sum of the square of residuals of the fit line

On normal function the equation [((X^T*X)*X^T))*Y] Provides the Y-intercept and The Slope of The Least Square Cost Function

Remember as demonstated by the code below

X^T=The transpose of X

X and Y = x and y values respectively

Follow the Python code for detailed comments and code
